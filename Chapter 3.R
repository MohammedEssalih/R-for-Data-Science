# Does it matter what order you used filter() and arrange() if you're using both? Why/why not? Think about the results and how much work the functions would have to do.
#There is no difference. Actually, the arrange function will arrange the data and the filter function will filter it. In the end, we will have the same data. But to win time, it is preferable to use the filter function before the arrange function
